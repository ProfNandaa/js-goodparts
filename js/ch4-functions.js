/*
* The best thing about JS is its implementation of functions.
	It got almost everything right.

* A function encloses a set of statements. Functions are 
	fundamental modular unit of JS.
* They are use for:
	- code resue
	- information hiding, and
	- composition
	* to specify the behavior of objects
