/*Numbers*/

/*
- JS has a single number type. Internally represented as a 64-bit floating
 point, the same as Java's double.

- Upside: problems of overlow in short intergets are completely avoided;
	a large class of number type errors are avoided.

- Value NaN is a number value that is the result of an operation that 
cannot produce a normal result. NaN is not equal to any value, including 
itself! You can detect NaN with the isNaN(number) function.

- JS has a Math object that contains a set of methods that act on numbers. 
e.g. Math.floor(number) method can be used to convert a number into 
an integer
